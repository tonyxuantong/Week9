# Week9
# Final Project-Mapping and visulization of Migratory Birds Data through R
# Introduction: 
Migratory birds comprise a significant portion of global biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services. Nevertheless, since many migratory birds regularly travel from one place to another over long distance, they can be influenced by many events across the land and sea in different regions and countries. Billions of dollars have been invested into conservation and numerous protected areas have been established to protect these migratory birds. Unfortunately, these conservation efforts do not always generate successful outcomes, and we still observe significant decline of migratory birdsâ€™ habitats and populations. According to the research from Birdlife International, 20% of the two thousand known bird species make regular seasonal migration and many of them have to travel thousands of miles to breed. More than 40% of them are declining and almost 200 species are globally threatened. 
 
# Rational: 
because the conservation of migratory animals is rather different from that of the non-migratory animals, thus: 
1. migratory animals can be more vulnerable due to the long distances they travel due to  the loss of breeding habitat and the changes in their wintering grounds and stopover sites. 
2. we had little information and knowledge about their migratory behavior. 
3. Many studies only focused on certain aspects of migratory birds instead of analyzing them with a holistic approach. 
 
# Objectives: 
this project aims to analyze and visulize the global migratory species distribution by comparing the migratory birds species count with the economic development level of different regions globally. This is to identify which regions have high level of human activities and high concentrations of migratory birds. These regions are most vital to the global migratory birds conservation. 
 
# Product:
I will provide a R package that include functions and sample data for:
1. Mapping threatened bird species per country globally
2. Visulizing and comparing bird status and economic development through maps and tabular data
3. Process raster data to analyze the migratory birds status within the contry.
